## Dataset
PlantSR Dataset could be downloaded from [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PlantSR_Dataset/24648150)

## Pretrained models
Pretrained models trained with PlantSR dataset could be downloaded from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/k3xqyu3zomu3insdqydnz/h?rlkey=8mwov9xap0bwsvou0dui7drsq&dl=0)

## Start
Use PlantSR.ipynb to train and inference PlantSR model. Some other SR models could be found at "others" derectory.    
Use PlantSRv2.ipynb to train and inference PlantSRv2 model.
